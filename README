This program "appelizes" your music into a separate directory.

It recodes audio files that don't work in the apple world (like flac and ogg)
and hardlinks the unknown ones (like mp3, jpeg and so on...). The result is a
space saving copy of your music.

At the moment it recodes everything to mp3, but other formats will be
supported in the future.
